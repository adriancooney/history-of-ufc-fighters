# A History of UFC Fights
This is the home of the source code for [https://github.io/adriancooney/history-of-ufc-fighters/](http://github.io/adriancooney/history-of-ufc-fighters/). Build with D3 and Lodash. Dataset based of old data from [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/47a7wh/ufc_fights_and_fighter_data/) but a scraper was built to pull down the newest data (and to match the old format).

Disclaimer: There's a couple of things that I'd like to change about the code that I can't be bothered to explain. Beware somethings are a little odd.
